# # Aviation Accident Analysis To Identifying the Safest Aircraft Makes and Models for Business Expansion

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify low-risk aircraft makes and models for business expansion. The insights provide data-driven purchasing decisions.
## Dataset
- **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses]
- **Contents:** The dataset includes accident reports, aircraft types, causes, and locations.

## Goals
The main objectives are:
- Analyze trends in aviation accidents over time.
- Identify common causes of aviation accidents.
- Examine accident distribution by aircraft make and model.
- Recommend the safest aircraft makes and models for purchase.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Pandas for handling missing values and structuring data.
- **Visualization:** Tableau and Matplotlib for clear, business-friendly insights.
- **Analysis:** Identified trends and patterns in aviation accidents.

## Key Findings
Weather conditions, Amateur built aircrafts,purpose of flight, aircraft damage and small number of engines are leading cause of accidents .

## Recommendations:
To minimize operational risks and enhance business success in aviation expansion: 
1. Prioritize commercial aircraft over private ones, as they exhibit lower accident rates under similar conditions.
2. If private flights are considered, enforce stricter safety protocols, including enhanced pilot training, rigorous maintenance checks, and advanced weather monitoring systems.
3. Invest in aircraft models with historically lower accident rates and operate primarily in favorable weather conditions (VMC) to reduce incident likelihood.
